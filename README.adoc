:version 1.1:
:downloads https://req42.de/downloads/:


req42 - the framework for effective, practical and pragmatic requirements
documentation and communication.

Initially created by Dr. Peter Hruschkaand Markus Meuten,
free and open source.


This repository contains all downloadable versions plus the (AsciiDoc)
source of the req42 framework.


It is used to:

*  generate (by the https://github.com/req42/req42-generator[req42-generator] project) the official download formats (i.e. docx, markdown, docbook and others).
* maintain structure, content and help for the framework
* keep non-asciidoc, non-generable formats (like Sparx(R) Enterprise-Architect(R) EAP).

In case you find issues within the framework or its explanations, this is the repo to fix and issue pull requests :-)
